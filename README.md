# 🧩 Day 26 - Simple Logging Decorator

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 26** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today, I explored one of Python’s most powerful features — **decorators** — by building a logging utility!

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus:
- Wrapping functions with decorators
- Adding logging without modifying the original logic
- Understanding function arguments and return interception

---

## 💭 Why Is This Useful?
Decorators are a clean and reusable way to **extend functionality** — logging is just one example. With a simple wrapper, we can:
- Monitor usage
- Debug easily
- Trace flow across multiple functions

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Automatically logs:
  - Function name
  - Arguments passed
  - Return value
- 🔁 Works with any function, without changing its core logic
- 🔍 Visualizes execution flow

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with:
- 🐍 Python 3
  - *args and **kwargs unpacking
  - @decorator syntax
  - Function nesting

## 🚀 Run the Program

```bash
python Day-26Code.py
