The provided code defines a Python decorator named simple_logger, which is used to log the execution of functions. A decorator in Python is a special function that can modify or enhance the behavior of other functions. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

simple_logger Decorator

1. Definition:
   - simple_logger(func) is a decorator function that takes another function func as its argument.

2. Wrapper Function:
   - Inside simple_logger(), a nested function wrapper(*args, kwargs) is defined. This function wraps around the original function func.
   - The *args and kwargs allow the wrapper to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively.

3. Logging Behavior:
   - Before calling the original function, it prints a message indicating the start of the function execution, including the function's 
     name and its arguments.
   - The original function func is then called with the provided arguments, and its return value is stored in result.
   - After the function execution, it prints another message indicating completion and displays the return value.
   - A separator line ("-" * 40) is printed for clarity in the console output.

4. Return:
   - The wrapper function returns the result obtained from calling the original function.

5. Returning the Wrapper:
   - The simple_logger function returns the wrapper function, effectively replacing the original function with this enhanced version.

Example Functions

1. greet(name):
   - A simple function that takes a name as input and returns a greeting message.

2. add(a, b):
   - A function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

3. divide(x, y):
   - A function that divides x by y. It includes a check to prevent division by zero, returning a specific message if y is zero.

Application of Decorator

- Each of these functions (greet, add, and divide) is decorated with @simple_logger.
- This means whenever these functions are called, they will first execute the logging behavior defined in the wrapper, then perform 
  their original task, and finally log their output.

Main Function
- The main() function demonstrates usage by calling each decorated function with specific arguments.
- It includes calls to:
  - greet("Jashwanth")
  - add(10, 5)
  - divide(8, 2)
  - divide(5, 0)

What I've learnt:
- A decorator is a design pattern that allows us to add new functionality to an existing object or function without modifying its structure. 
  Decorators are often used to wrap another function in order to extend its behaviour.
- The decorator is called with '@' followed by function name.
